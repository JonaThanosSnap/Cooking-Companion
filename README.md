Description: Made in Python, this project uses the CSV and Tkinter libraries to help users choose their food based on their owned ingredients. Using a database of different recipes which include their name, ratings, difficulty, type of dish, time required, and ingredients, our goal was to help users make informed decisions on what their next meal would comprise of.
